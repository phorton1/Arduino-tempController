# tempearature Controller


This is an ESP32 based Relay controller based on a **DS18B20** temperature
sensors.

## Please Also See

This project directly makes direct use of my
[**MyIOT**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-libraries-myIOT)
("my internet of things*) repository, which provides a generalized approach to
building relatively simple parameter driven ESP32 devices that include a Web UI.

Other projects that also make user of the *myIOT* repository include the
[**fridgeController**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-fridgeController)
and
[**Bilge Alarm**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-bilgeAlarm)
devices that I built for my boat, and
[**Wooden Geared Clock**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-theClock3)
that uses an electromagnet to drive a pendulum, and the
[**Wire Cutter and Stripper**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-wireStripper32)
.

The PCBs (printed circuit boards) were **milled** using the
[**cnc3018**](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-esp32_cnc3018) CNC
machine that I built.

I hope you will take a few minutes to check out some of these other pages too!!


## Credits
